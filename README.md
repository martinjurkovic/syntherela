# SyntheRela (Synthetic Relational Data Generation Benchmark)

## Installation
To install only the benchmark package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Running reproducibility experiments
We divide the reproducibility of the experiments into two parts: the generation of synthetic data and the evaluation of the generated data. The following sections describe how to reproduce the experiments for each part.

### Generation of synthetic data
Depending on the synthetic data generation method a separate pythone environment is needed. The instruction for installing the required environment for each method is provided in [INSTALLATION.md](/INSTALLATION.md).

After installing the required environment, the synthetic data can be generated by running the following command:

```bash
experiments/reproducibility/generation/generate_<method>.sh
```

Where <method> can be one of the following: `SDV`, `rctgan`, `realtabformer` or `tabular`.

The authors declare no conflict of interest and are not associated with any of the evaluated commercial synthetic data providers.
