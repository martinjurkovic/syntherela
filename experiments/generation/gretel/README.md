## Generating Data using GRETEL AI

In this repository we use a modified version of Gretel AI's [synthesize_relational_database.ipynb](https://github.com/gretelai/gretel-blueprints/blob/develop/docs/notebooks/synthesize_relational_database.ipynb) to generate synthetic data. 

## A Note on Reproducibility
> The platform does not provide an option to set a seed for reproducibility. Therefore, the generated data might vary from our runs. For this reason we provide scripts for downloading the data generated in our runs in the `experiments/data` directory.
