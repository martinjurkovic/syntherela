## Generating Data using GRETEL AI

In this repository we use a modified version of TODO to generate synthetic data. 

## A Note on Reproducibility
> The platform does not provide an option to set a seed for reproducibility. Therefore, the generated data will vary from our runs. For this reason we provide scripts for generating the data generated in our runs in the `experiments/data` directory.
